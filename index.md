# §1 Preface

Dīoliwao is a constructed language or a _conlang_一a language that came about as a result of conscious and deliberate means; whose phonology, grammar, and vocabulary are purposefully developed rather than naturally evolving. While Dīoliwao is a constructed language, thereby developed intentionally, it still allows for and encourages natural evolution and growth. Language is by no means static. It is constantly evolving to suit the needs of the user. After all, language is a tool, by far one of the most, if not the most, important tools we use daily. For a language to be strictly fixed would be for it to be an ineffective tool and means of communication. Due to this fact, speakers and non-speakers of Dīoliwao alike are encouraged to bring about change to this language for the better.

Note that conlanging is a form of expression一artistically, linguistically, and so much more一it allows for the communication or demonstration of deeply personal concepts to very broad and public ideas. Ultimately, that’s what language as a whole is at its core. A means to express ideas and concepts in both representational and abstract ways. Conlanging is also a hobby, albeit a difficult one to communicate to those unfamiliar with its concept. To view conlanging as an instrument of conveying ideas to a large audience would be unrealistic. It’s likely many have never viewed language as a tool of creativity or expression, rather simply a skill they possess and use often. The problem with conlanging is that it’s only ever fully appreciated by its creator. Only he who meticulously constructed his creation will ever possess the full knowledge of its inner workings, will ever understand the effort and passion put into it, will ever long for it with a greater passion than others.

And so is the case for God. God, infinite in His love and power created us in His own image. Thus, as our Creator, He possesses a rich and intimate knowledge, passion, and longing for us that even we ourselves are incapable of understanding or fully appreciating. Thus, Dīoliwao; literally, “God language”.  Or, to put it more connotatively, “the expression, worship, and communication of, to, and for God via the aid of linguistic means''. Dīoliwao, while finite and imperfect, aims to aid communication on the basis of God. I, by no means, claim this language to be perfect or divinely inspired by God in any fashion, however, I did create this language as a form of veneration to God and the passions He has given me. All glory goes to God, even the heavens themselves declare His glory.
